# Developed Bots for the game in Algorithms course FME 2022

Code developed to enter the contest inside the Algorithms course 2022.
The contest consists of programming an algorithm that plays a game (regles-TWD.pdf) and beats the other participants. The code is developed in C++.

A simulator is also provided (simulator.py, simulator1py) that given the 4 names of the players and a number of matches, executes them and returns the percentage of win of every player and the seeds where they win.

The latest algorithm that I presented was __Leonidas2__ and it ranked top 8/45.

The game was developed by Albert Oliveras (oliveras@cs.upc.edu), Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, 2022.
