# Developed Bots for the game in Algorithms course FME 2022

Code developed to enter the contest inside the Algorithms course 2022. Gamefiles are also included, algorithms start with AI, and AINull.cc does nothing, and AIDummy is the a player given by the teachers to practice.

The contest consists of programming an algorithm that plays a game (regles-TWD.pdf) and beats the other participants. The code is developed in C++.

A simulator is also provided (simulator.py, simulator1py) that given the 4 names of the players and a number of matches, executes them and returns the percentage of win of every player and the seeds where they win.

The latest algorithm that I presented was __Leonidas2__ and it ranked top 8/45.

The game was developed by Albert Oliveras (oliveras@cs.upc.edu), Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, 2022.
